## Introduction
Hey ğŸ‘‹
InÂ want to keep track of the time I need to do certain tasks, so I started to jot down my start and end times eventually calculating the duration. ThisÂ became quickly veryÂ tedious,Â so IÂ decidedÂ toÂ createÂ myÂ ownÂ time trackerÂ andÂ viewÂ thisÂ asÂ anÂ opportunityÂ toÂ strengthenÂ myÂ JavaScriptÂ skills.Â IÂ useÂ aÂ simpleÂ setIntervalÂ forÂ this, asÂ IÂ doÂ notÂ needÂ theÂ timesÂ toÂ beÂ superÂ accurateÂ (yet).Â

## Problems and Learnings
During development, I took the longest time to clean up the code, as I am quite uncertain when to use a function to keep the code dry or just leave things as they are. Also, naming functions is hard. 

Learned about Object.key() and Object.entries() to loop over objects and how to pass them over to functions.

## Future Plans
* create different projects and name them
* choose the project I want to track the time on 
* delete projects when there are done
* using Date()
